# DNS Host Name Mapping

## Task DNS Host Name Mapping

## Conditions

Given a responderâ€™s computer, a known network topology including IP address ranges, and the proper tools to map network hosts.

> **Operator Note:** Ensure the topology and IP ranges have been confirmed with the mission network owner prior to scanning.

## Standards

* Team member selects an appropriate tool for conducting host scans of the network  
* Team member configures the tool to do a full or partial (i.e., per subnet) scan of the network and saves the results to a text or comma-separated values (CSV) file  

> **Operator Note:** Where available, use tools that resolve hostnames via DNS, NetBIOS or other name resolution protocols for best results.

## End State

* A list of all accessible computers within the given IP ranges are listed with their domain name and IP addresses  
* These scripts are meant to be an Out-Of-the-Box (OOB) solution to Cybersecurity Operations  
* All scripts are open source and can be branched/edited as needed

> **Operator Note:** Save results using the naming convention noted below and share with the incident coordination lead and intelligence team.

## Manual Steps

There are multiple tools available to scan network IP ranges and determine their host names. While a simple ping scan using the built-in Ping tool in Windows will work, the difficulty is that some Operating Systems (OS) block ICMP pings by default. Additionally network administrators may institute a firewall policy to block ICMP across the Enterprise. In those cases a simple ping sweep will not work. In this case, other 3rd-party tools will be more effective, Nmap being one of the most effective.

* Example Host Discovery scan with Nmap: On a network with working DNS server, this scan will return all live hosts on this network. For network hosts that do not synch with the local DHCP or DNS server this scan may not return the host name.

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

* If the above scan does not return hostnames (poorly configured DNS issues), then the following script can be run to further enumerate Windows hosts and possible return the hostname:

```bash
nmap -sU --script nbstat.nse -p137 192.168.1.0/24
```

* Output should be in the format identified in 'output_format_template.csv' and named as follows:

```
[mm/dd/yyyy_hh:mm:ss_DNS_HOSTNAME_Mapping_(xx.xx.xx.xx/x)]
```

* Notify mission element lead and intelligence analyst of completion of this Task.

> **Operator Note:** Where possible, validate unknown hostnames using reverse DNS, Active Directory, or administrative tools on the network.

## Running Script

* Runs the script as Admin for full capabilities  
* Script execution is menu driven  
* Ensure the script is executable  

```bash
chmod 755 dns_hostname_mapping.py
```

* Windows:

> Right-click script file, Properties/Unblock

* Execute the script (Linux/Mac/Windows):

```bash
python dns_hostname_mapping.py
```

* Python 3 version:

```bash
python3 dns_hostname_mapping_py3.py
```

* Select a menu option  
* Specify the IP address range to be scanned  
* Specify the path and filename for output files

> **Operator Note:** Always review script output for errors or incomplete scans.

## Dependencies

* [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)

> **Operator Note:** Ensure Python and Nmap are updated to avoid deprecated module issues.

## Other available tools

* Windows: `Resolve-DnsName` (PowerShell) for DNS lookups
* Linux/macOS: `dig` or `host` command
* Mobile: `Fing` app for basic hostname resolution

## Operator Recommendations and Additional Tools

### Operator Checklist

- [ ] Verify target IP range with network owner.
- [ ] Use Nmap with DNS first, then fallback to NetBIOS NBSTAT if DNS is unavailable.
- [ ] Always run scripts with administrative permissions.
- [ ] Record and save results in CSV as per naming convention.
- [ ] Review results with NetOps / AD administrators for unknown hosts.

### Tools by Platform

| Platform | Tool | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Universal | Nmap (SN scan + NBSTAT NSE script) | Primary hostname resolution |
| Universal | dns_hostname_mapping.py (menu script) | Automated hostname resolution |
| Windows | Resolve-DnsName | Built-in Windows DNS resolver |
| Linux/macOS | dig / host | Built-in Unix/Linux hostname resolution |
| Mobile | Fing | Lightweight mobile host discovery |

### Alternate Commands

#### Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Resolve-DnsName -Name 192.168.1.10
```

#### Linux:

```bash
dig -x 192.168.1.10
```

### Best Practices

- Use passive resolution methods first to reduce network impact.
- Avoid aggressive scanning in sensitive segments.
- Cross-validate results using multiple tools if DNS returns inconsistent results.

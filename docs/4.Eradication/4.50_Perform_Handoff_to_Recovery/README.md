# 4.50 Perform Handoff to Recovery Teams

## Task Perform Formal Handoff of Remediation and Restoration Activities to Recovery Teams

## Conditions

With eradication activities completed and transition approved, the operator will perform a structured handoff to recovery teams. This includes sharing key information about the incident, eradication steps, any residual risks, and recovery guidance to ensure smooth and secure restoration of normal operations.

> **Operator Note:** Poor handoff can lead to gaps in recovery and re-introduction of risks. Treat handoff as a critical milestone with required artifacts and approval steps.

## Standards

* Team member ensures all eradication actions and validation are documented and complete.
* Team member prepares and delivers a formal handoff package to recovery teams.
* Team member ensures recovery teams fully understand the eradication context and any caveats.
* Team member obtains confirmation from recovery team lead that handoff is accepted.
* Team member records handoff completion in incident tracking system.

## End State

All required eradication information, residual risk guidance, and recovery caveats have been handed off and accepted by recovery teams. Recovery activities begin with full situational awareness.

---

## Notes

- Handoff should be planned and scheduled as a formal event or meeting when possible.
- Recovery teams should include IT Operations, System Administrators, Application Owners, and IT Security.
- Retain handoff package and meeting records for after-action review and compliance.

---

## Manual Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Handoff Package

Create handoff documentation that includes:

- **Incident Summary**
  - Timeline of incident
  - Impacted systems
  - Root cause summary (if available)

- **Eradication Summary**
  - Actions taken to eradicate malicious artifacts
  - Validation steps and results
  - Outstanding issues or risks

- **Recovery Guidance**
  - Systems ready for recovery
  - Order of recovery (e.g., infrastructure → apps → users)
  - Special instructions (e.g., rebuild instead of restore)

- **Residual Risks and Monitoring Requirements**
  - What to watch for (possible indicators of reinfection)
  - Monitoring plan (EDR, firewall, DNS, etc.)
  - Rollback plan if issues occur during recovery

> **Operator Note:** Templates or handoff forms can be used to standardize this process.

---

### Step 2: Schedule and Conduct Handoff Briefing

- Schedule recovery handoff meeting or coordination session.
- Participants should include:
  - IR Lead
  - Recovery Team Lead(s)
  - IT Operations
  - System/Business Owners
  - Cybersecurity monitoring team

- Walk through handoff package:
  - Confirm eradication completion
  - Review recovery process and caveats
  - Confirm monitoring requirements and escalation paths

> **Operator Note:** Virtual meetings with screen sharing and recording are recommended for audit trail.

---

### Step 3: Deliver Artifacts and Transition Documentation

Provide recovery teams with:

- Handoff document or briefing deck
- Validation reports (scans, task/service reviews, etc.)
- Artifact retention locations (malware samples, logs, etc.)
- Recovery instructions (systems approved to bring online, order of operations)

> **Operator Note:** Use enterprise collaboration platforms (SharePoint, Teams, secured shared drives) to store and share handoff packages securely.

---

### Step 4: Obtain Acknowledgement and Approval to Proceed

- Ensure Recovery Team Lead formally accepts handoff:
  - Verbal (recorded during meeting)
  - Written (email confirmation or ticket approval)

- Record acceptance and transition status in incident tracking system.

> **Operator Note:** This approval serves as a control gate to officially exit eradication phase.

---

### Step 5: Monitor Initial Recovery Actions (as applicable)

- Remain available as IR team POC during early recovery.
- Review first systems brought online for any issues.
- Escalate to IR Lead if re-infection or security issues arise.

> **Operator Note:** Recovery and IR remain linked until full business restoration and no new incidents are detected.

---

## Running Script (Document and Capture Validation Status)

```powershell
Get-Date | Out-File RecoveryHandoffLog.txt
Write-Output "Eradication validation completed. Transition to recovery initiated." | Out-File -Append RecoveryHandoffLog.txt
```

> **Operator Note:** Always record dates/times of phase changes in incident records.

---

## Dependencies

* Eradication and validation phase must be formally completed
* All system owners and recovery teams must be identified and ready
* Handoff package prepared and available
* IR Lead and Recovery Lead available for coordination

---

## Other Available Tools

| Tool | Platform | Installation | Usage |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Ticketing/ITSM (ServiceNow, Jira) | Cross-platform | Enterprise | Record handoff, approvals, and completion |
| SharePoint / Teams / Confluence | Cross-platform | Enterprise | Share handoff package and recovery instructions |
| Email + Calendar | Cross-platform | Built-in | Schedule and confirm handoff |
| Enterprise EDR/XDR platforms | Cross-platform | Enterprise | Prepare for recovery monitoring |

> **Operator Note:** Where available, use existing ITSM and documentation platforms to integrate handoff processes.

## Operator Recommendations and Additional Tools

### Operator Checklist

- [ ] Prepare handoff package with incident, eradication, validation, and recovery info.
- [ ] Schedule handoff meeting and invite all recovery stakeholders.
- [ ] Walk through handoff package and confirm understanding.
- [ ] Deliver package and obtain formal handoff acceptance.
- [ ] Update IR records and transition incident phase.
- [ ] Support initial recovery actions as needed.

### Best Practices

- Use structured handoff templates or checklists to ensure nothing is missed.
- Confirm understanding during handoff meeting → ask for questions/concerns.
- Retain all artifacts and meeting records in incident archive.
- Coordinate closely with monitoring teams for early detection of any issues post-recovery.

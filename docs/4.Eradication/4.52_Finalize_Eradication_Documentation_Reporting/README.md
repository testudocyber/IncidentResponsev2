# 4.52 Finalize Eradication Documentation and Reporting

## Task Document All Eradication Activities and Validate Final Reporting for Handoff and Retention

## Conditions

After eradication and recovery monitoring have been completed and validated, the operator and IR team will finalize all eradication-related documentation. This serves as the official record of eradication actions, validates clean state of systems, and provides inputs for post-incident reporting and lessons learned.

> **Operator Note:** Eradication documentation ensures traceability, enables post-incident analysis, and supports audits and regulatory compliance. Every step taken during eradication should be captured clearly and accurately.

## Standards

* Team member collects and consolidates all eradication action logs, records, and outputs.
* Team member completes eradication summary documentation for each impacted system.
* Team member records all findings, residual risks, and validations performed.
* Team member prepares and submits eradication completion report to Incident Response Lead.
* Team member ensures records are stored securely and made available for after-action review.

## End State

A complete eradication report package is created, reviewed, and submitted for retention. This package includes records of all actions, validation outcomes, and supporting evidence.

---

## Notes

- Eradication documentation should link to original source records (e.g., AV scan results, system inventories, validation logs).
- Reports may be reviewed months later â†’ clear, detailed language should be used.
- Coordination with recovery and enterprise teams ensures completeness.

---

## Manual Steps

### Step 1: Gather Eradication Records and Evidence

Records to collect:

- Task, script, and action logs (e.g., scheduled task removals, user account deletions)
- Scan results (AV, persistence checks, EDR scans)
- Network logs (confirmation of no beaconing or malicious activity)
- System validation results (recovery readiness validation)
- Operator notes and IR coordination records

> **Operator Note:** Use incident ticketing systems, centralized IR drives, and SIEM exports to collect source records.

### Step 2: Prepare Eradication Summary Report

#### Report Sections

- **Incident Overview**
  - Timeline
  - Affected systems
  - Root cause summary (if determined)

- **Eradication Actions**
  - Steps taken to remove attacker access and artifacts
  - Tools and commands/scripts used
  - Operator responsible for actions

- **Validation Summary**
  - How clean state was confirmed
  - Any residual risks or deferred remediation actions

- **Transition to Recovery**
  - Recovery approval
  - Recovery activities started

- **Supporting Evidence**
  - Links to or attachments of key artifacts

> **Operator Note:** Use standardized templates if available for consistency.

---

### Step 3: Review and Approve Documentation

- Review eradication report internally (IR lead + operators)
- Validate completeness and clarity
- Approve for submission and archiving

> **Operator Note:** IR Lead is responsible for final approval of eradication documentation.

---

### Step 4: Submit and Archive Documentation

- Submit final eradication report to:
  - Incident Manager / Crisis Management Team
  - Cybersecurity leadership
  - Compliance (if regulatory incident)

- Archive eradication records securely:
  - Incident Response SharePoint or Document Management System
  - Long-term retention repository

> **Operator Note:** Follow organization policy for document retention (typically 1-3 years minimum for security incidents).

---

### Step 5: Prepare for Lessons Learned Phase

- Tag documentation for handoff to Lessons Learned team (if separate)
- Include open items or recommendations for future improvements

> **Operator Note:** All eradication gaps or challenges should be flagged for discussion in After Action Review.

---

## Running Script (Example - Record Cleanup Validation to File)

```powershell
Get-Date | Out-File EradicationCompletion.txt
Write-Output "Eradication activities completed and validated. No remaining attacker artifacts found." | Out-File -Append EradicationCompletion.txt
```

---

## Dependencies

* Completed eradication and recovery monitoring phases
* Full set of logs and records from eradication phase
* IR lead available for review and approval

## Other Available Tools

| Tool | Platform | Installation | Usage |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|
| ITSM / Incident Tracking (ServiceNow, Jira) | Cross-platform | Enterprise tool | Link and record eradication actions |
| SharePoint / Confluence | Cross-platform | Enterprise tool | Archive eradication report |
| SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, ELK) | Cross-platform | Enterprise tool | Export supporting log evidence |
| Word / PDF Templates | Cross-platform | Standard Office tools | Generate eradication report documents |

> **Operator Note:** Use enterprise-standard formats for reporting (Word, PDF) for ease of distribution and review.

## Operator Recommendations and Additional Tools

### Operator Checklist

- [ ] Collect all eradication actions and validation evidence.
- [ ] Prepare standardized eradication summary report.
- [ ] Review report internally and obtain IR lead approval.
- [ ] Submit and archive eradication report package.
- [ ] Prepare report and artifacts for Lessons Learned handoff.

### Best Practices

- Provide concise but detailed narrative in eradication summary.
- Include evidence to support each eradication claim.
- Clearly document any residual risks or deferred actions.
- Retain eradication report and supporting records for audit and future incidents.

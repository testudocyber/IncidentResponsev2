# Interview Network Owner Task

## Purpose

Identify available tools, sensors, and network monitoring capabilities through structured discussion with the mission owner. Use this information to understand the environment and propose additional capabilities as needed.

## Standards

An IR Team deploys to an existing network that may or may not have adequate sensors to complete the mission.  
It is important to discuss existing sensors, network monitoring and cyber defense tools (firewalls, SIEM, malware detection, discovery/mapping tools) with the mission owner.  
Based on this interview, determine what tools are already in place and discuss additional needs.

# Finalize Documentation and Transition to Eradication

## Task Finalize Containment Documentation and Prepare for Transition to Eradication

## Conditions

Given that containment actions have been completed and validated, the operator will ensure all containment documentation is finalized, verified, and prepared for transition to the eradication phase. This includes ensuring IR stakeholders are aligned and approve progression.

> **Operator Note:** This step is the bridge from containment to eradication. Accurate, complete documentation enables clear handoff, prevents gaps in incident response, and supports later lessons learned and reporting.

## Standards

* Team member consolidates all containment records and documentation.  
* Team member ensures all containment actions, validations, and outbrief outcomes are fully logged.  
* Team member reviews and verifies documentation with IR lead and key stakeholders.  
* Team member updates incident timeline and artifacts in IR management platform or designated repository.  
* Team member facilitates transition meeting and receives formal approval to move into eradication.

## End State

Containment documentation is finalized and reviewed, and the IR team and stakeholders agree that the incident is ready to move into eradication phase.

## Notes

- The transition to eradication should never be automatic â†’ formal sign-off is required.  
- Documentation should support future forensic analysis, recovery planning, and lessons learned activities.  
- Proper documentation also supports legal, regulatory, and audit requirements.

## Manual Steps

### Step 1: Consolidate Containment Documentation

- Collect action logs (scripts, operator notes, ticketing systems)  
- Include containment outbrief summary  
- Validate host-based, network-based, identity/account containment records  
- Collect validation evidence (screenshots, log excerpts, etc.)

> **Operator Note:** Review against containment checklist to ensure completeness.

---

### Step 2: Validate with IR Lead and Stakeholders

- Review documentation in IR team meeting or async review  
- Validate that all containment actions are closed or risk-accepted  
- Obtain sign-off from IR lead or Incident Commander

```plaintext
[ ] Containment actions completed
[ ] Validation completed
[ ] Residual risk documented
[ ] Approved to proceed to eradication
```

---

### Step 3: Update Incident Timeline and Repository

- Update central IR tracker or playbook
- Upload finalized documentation to IR file repository (SharePoint, Confluence, ticketing system, etc.)
- Update incident timeline and summary document

```plaintext
2025-05-02 1400 - Containment Outbrief complete
2025-05-02 1600 - Containment validation complete
2025-05-02 1700 - Approved to begin eradication
```

---

### Step 4: Facilitate Eradication Transition Meeting (Optional but Recommended)

Recommended attendees:

- IR Lead
- Incident Response Team
- Enclave/System Owner
- IT Operations Lead
- Recovery team lead (if defined)

Recommended Agenda:

1. Summary of containment actions and success
2. Review of residual risks or exceptions
3. Eradication plan overview and ownership
4. Approval to transition

> **Operator Note:** Document meeting notes and decision in incident record.

## Running Script (PowerShell - Export Final Action Log)

```powershell
$containmentFinal = @()

$containmentFinal += [PSCustomObject]@{
    Action = "Block C2 IPs via Firewall ACL"
    System = "Firewall-Edge01"
    Operator = "Leo"
    Completed = "Yes"
    Notes = "No further outbound traffic observed"
}

$containmentFinal | Export-Csv -Path .\FinalContainmentActions.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

---

## Dependencies

* IR documentation repository (SharePoint, Wiki, Ticketing System)  
* IR lead and key stakeholders availability  
* Access to all containment action records  
* Transition plan for eradication phase

## Other Available Tools

| Tool | Platform | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| SharePoint / Confluence / Markdown | Cross-platform | Store finalized documentation |
| Ticketing System (Jira, ServiceNow) | Enterprise | Track approvals and transitions |
| Email / Teams / Zoom | Cross-platform | Outbrief and eradication planning |
| PowerShell | Windows | Scripted export of logs and containment actions |

## Operator Recommendations and Additional Tools

### Operator Checklist

- [ ] Consolidate all containment documentation
- [ ] Validate completeness and accuracy with IR team
- [ ] Obtain IR lead or Incident Commander sign-off
- [ ] Update central IR record and timeline
- [ ] Facilitate eradication transition meeting or communication
- [ ] Document transition approval and move to eradication

### Best Practices

- Do not move to eradication without IR lead sign-off.
- Ensure all containment gaps or risks are formally recorded and tracked.
- Prepare eradication team with full context and known issues.
- Retain containment documentation in IR case files for future lessons learned and reporting.
